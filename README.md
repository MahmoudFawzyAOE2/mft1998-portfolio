# Personal Portfolio

## ✨ About 

I used **Lovable AI** to generate the initial structure and layout of the main pages.  
From there, I explored the codebase and its hierarchy to understand the flow and structure, then customized and refined the site using a mix of personal coding ("vibe coding") and suggestions from **GitHub Copilot**.
